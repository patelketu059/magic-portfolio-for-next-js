## 3. Design Philosophy

The design was inspired by [mitchellsparrow.com](https://www.mitchellsparrow.com/), focusing on:

### 3.1 Minimalism
- Clean layouts with generous whitespace
- Typography-driven hierarchy
- Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### 3.2 Accessibility
- Semantic HTML for better screen reader support
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast ratios for readability

### 3.3 Performance
- Lazy loading for images and components
- Minimal JavaScript bundle sizes
- Efficient CSS with CSS Modules (no runtime CSS-in-JS)

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

### 4.1 Layout Context Provider Issue

**Challenge:** The Once UI design system required a LayoutProvider context, but using layout components before the provider was initialized caused errors.

**Solution:** 
- Restructured the layout to use plain HTML elements (`<html>`, `<body>`) outside the provider
- Wrapped all Once UI components inside the `<Providers>` component
- Used CSS Modules for custom components to avoid context dependencies

### 4.2 Server vs Client Components

**Challenge:** Balancing server-side rendering benefits with client-side interactivity.

**Solution:**
- Kept page components as server components for metadata and SEO
- Created separate client components for interactive features (typing animation, hover states)
- Used the `"use client"` directive strategically

### 4.3 Smooth Scrolling

**Challenge:** Implementing smooth scrolling between sections with proper anchor positioning.

**Solution:**
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` to the HTML element
- Used `scroll-margin-top` for sections to account for fixed header
- Implemented proper section IDs for anchor navigation

## 5. Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** with persistent user preference
- **Blog section** for technical writing and tutorials
- **Project filtering** by technology or category
- **Contact form** with email integration
- **Analytics** to track visitor engagement
- **Parallax effects** on scroll for enhanced visual interest
- **Case study pages** with detailed project breakdowns

### Performance Improvements
- **Image lazy loading** with blur-up placeholders
- **Code splitting** for faster initial page loads
- **Service worker** for offline support
- **CDN optimization** for global content delivery
